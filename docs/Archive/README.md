# Archive - Historical Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation, implementation summaries, and completed work items from the development of AGenesysToolKit. These documents are preserved for historical reference but are not essential for new users or contributors.

## What's Here

### Implementation Summaries
Historical records of how specific features were implemented:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY*.md` - OAuth, parameter plumbing, reporting, UI fixes, timeline features

## Why Archive These?

These documents were valuable during development but are not needed by:
- **New users** cloning the repo for the first time
- **Genesys Cloud API developers** getting started with the toolkit
- **Administrators** deploying the application

The information in these documents has been:
- ✅ Integrated into the current codebase
- ✅ Documented in user-facing guides (README, QUICKREF, etc.)
- ✅ Captured in CHANGELOG.md version history

## If You Need Current Documentation

See the main documentation in the repository root and `/docs` folder:

| Need | Document |
|------|----------|
| Getting started | [README.md](../../README.md) |
| Daily operations | [QUICKREF.md](../../QUICKREF.md) |
| OAuth setup | [CONFIGURATION.md](../CONFIGURATION.md) |
| Development | [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Architecture | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Testing | [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md) |
| Deployment | [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) |

## Retention Policy

These archived documents are retained for:
- Historical reference by maintainers
- Understanding design decisions
- Tracking evolution of the codebase

They may be removed in future versions if no longer needed.
